## 📘 NED University | C++ Language Course — Second Semester

This repository contains all code and materials from the **C++ Language course** completed during my second semester at [NED University of Engineering and Technology](https://www.neduet.edu.pk/). It serves as a comprehensive record of my practical work and growth in object-oriented and systems-level programming.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The content is organized into modular directories for clarity and ease of navigation:

- `practice-codes/` — Small programs for personal experimentation and concept reinforcement  
- `projects/` — Larger, self-contained projects, each in its own subfolder  
- `labs/` — Weekly lab exercises and solutions  
- `assignments/` — Graded coursework submitted during the semester

## 🔐 Highlighted Project

- **Encryption & Decryption Toolkit** — Implemented cryptographic algorithms including:
  - DES (Data Encryption Standard)  
  - RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)  
  - AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)  

This project reflects my early interest in cybersecurity and cryptographic protocol design.

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

Throughout this course, I built a strong foundation in:

- **Syntax & Data Types** — Variables, operators, and type declarations  
- **Control Structures** — `if`, `else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
- **Functions** — Definition, argument passing, and scope management  
- **Arrays & Strings** — 1D/2D arrays and string manipulation  
- **Pointers & Memory** — Pointer arithmetic and dynamic memory (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`)  
- **Structures & Unions** — Custom data types for modular design  
- **File I/O** — Reading from and writing to files for persistent storage

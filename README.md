NED University | C++ Language Course - Second Semester
This repository contains all the code and materials from the C Language course, I completed during my first semester at NED University of Engineering and Technology.

It serves as a comprehensive record of my practical work, including:
● Personal practice codes
● Projects developed by me
● Laboratory exercises
● Assignments given by the course instructor

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my progress and understanding of fundamental C programming concepts.

## Repository Structure
The files are organized into clear directories to make it easy to navigate the different types of work.
● practice-codes/: A collection of small programs for personal practice and experimentation.
● projects/: This directory contains larger, self-contained projects. Each project is in its own subfolder.
● labs/: Code and solutions for the weekly laboratory sessions.
● assignments/: Solutions to the graded assignments given throughout the semester.

## Projects
This section highlights the main projects I completed.
● Encryption / Decryption Using DES, RSA, AES Algorithms

## Key Learning Outcomes
Throughout this course, I developed a strong foundation in core C programming principles, including: 
● Fundamental Syntax: Variables, data types, and operators.
● Control Structures: if, else, switch, for, while, and do-while loops.
● Functions: Creating and using functions, passing arguments, and understanding scope.
● Arrays and Strings: Working with one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays, and performing string manipulation.
● Pointers: Understanding memory addresses, pointer arithmetic, and dynamic memory allocation (malloc, calloc, realloc, free).
● Structures and Unions: Defining and using custom data types.
● File I/O: Reading from and writing to files.
